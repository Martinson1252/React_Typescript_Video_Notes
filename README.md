## Video Notes

An app created using `React`, `Node.js` and `Typescript`.  
It enables creating notes of video frames and saving them on physical drive.  
It has 2 sides `client` and `server`.  
Client handles frontend while the server handles the backend including saving files on local drive and synchronizing the data.  
When in drawing mode user has basic tools such us: Pen, Line, Circle, Square, Rectangle, Eraser, Color Selector.  
Notes appear on left side panel.  
When a note is clicked the app automatically moves to the specific frame with the note.  
Each note can be renamed and deleted.   
All the icons were made by me.
